DONE:
For fetching the scoped interests for the user to choose from.

ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag.find(:all, :joins => :taggings, :conditions => { :taggings => { :context => "cuisines" }}, :select => "distinct(tags.*)")

TODO:
Still here: 
  - emulating the down/enter events is tricky due to limitations built in
  - we are loosing the contents of the autoselect text field when selecting from menu 
  
enter key select the first completion in the menu. 

speccing the key press events .. partial typing and down arrow + enter will autocomplete
